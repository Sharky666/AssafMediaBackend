change the DAOs to be a static class or only export their methods (it's a problem because it's difficult to declare static methods from an abstract class, do it anyway)

 thus decoupling the code's structure and allowing for more dynamic and scalable arhitecture

 change epoch_time in userService to a more appropriate data type
